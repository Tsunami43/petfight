## Architecture

The project is built on a **microservices architecture**, allowing for flexibility and scalability.

### Technologies

- **Backend**: Python using FastAPI for fast and efficient request handling.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, ensuring reliable storage of user data.
- **Frontend**: Flutter with Provider for creating an intuitive user interface.
- **Server**: Caddyfile for simplified web server management and routing.

## Security

User data is protected during the transition from Telegram to the application through authentication checks. This ensures that only authorized users can access the app's features.
